\section{Technical details}\label{sec:tech}
This section reviews some technical details of the implementation of the pipeline. Except for algorithm \ref{algo:sgs} and some more helper functions for operations on graphs that have been implemented in c++ all has been written in python under heavy use of the libraries pytorch, numpy, scipy and skimage. The c++ implementations are called from the python interpreter using the pybind11 interface together with the xtensor libraries.\\
pytorch multiprocessing is used for parallelization and synchronization in the fashion of the A3C (section \ref{ssec::a3c}). After each update step through graph convolutions in section \ref{sec:sag_gcn} node and edge features are normalized by a Batch Normalization layer \cite{ioffe2015batch}.\\
There embedding space is $\mathbb{R}^{16}$ and the node features in section \ref{sec:sag_gcn} are in the embedding space $x_{i}^0 \in \mathbb{R}^{16}$
